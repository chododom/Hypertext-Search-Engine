The Faculty is in introducing its results not only to the experts but also to the general public for the long time. In addition to the press publications you can find concurrent information at our Facebook profile, LinkedIn profile and also at our YouTube channel. We organize open days as well as many other events at the faculty throughout a year.
For all applicants of cooperations with our faculty we offer many different possibilities of promotion at the faculty. We are also ready to find other ways of cooperation such as contractual partnership with the faculty.
