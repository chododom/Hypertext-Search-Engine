siegetom (at) fel.cvut.cz
Tomáš Sieger is a researcher at the Dept. of Cybernetics at the FEE, CTU and the Dept. of Neurology and Center of Clinical Neuroscience at the Charles University in Prague. He studied computer science at the Charles University in Prague and (bio)statistics at the  Charles University and the University of Hasselt, Belgium. He received his PhD from FEE, CTU in 2014. Focused on biomedical data analysis and modeling, he works primarily to understand the functioning of the human brain. He also buids models of flow-cytometry data and develops software for data analysis (he wrote idendro, an interactive dendrogram exploration tool, and contributed to ggplot2, a popular R data visualization package). He is/was leading TA for courses on Logic programming, Data mining, and Statistics. See his ResearchGate profile for more information.

petr.posik (at) fel.cvut.cz
Petr Pošík received his Diploma degree in Technical Cybernetics in 2001 and Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Biocybernetics in 2007, both from the Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic. From 2001 to 2004 he also worked as a statistician, analyst and lecturer for StatSoft, Czech Republic. Since 2005 he works as a researcher at the Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University. Being on the boundary of optimization, statistics and machine learning, his research interests are aimed at improving the characteristics of evolutionary algorithms with techniques of statistical machine learning. He has published 5 journal articles, and over 25 conference papers. Petr is also a member of the editorial board of the Evolutionary Computation Journal, MIT Press, and serves as a reviewer for several journals and conferences in the field of evolutionary-computation.
