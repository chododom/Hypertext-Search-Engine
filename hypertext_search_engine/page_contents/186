My name is Miguel Amável Pinheiro and I'm a PhD student at the Czech Technical University in Prague and working on the Center for Machine Perception at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering.
My main research is "Automatic analysis of light and electron microscopy neuronal data" and it is supervised by Dr. Jan Kybic.
I'm originally a graduate from the Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, where I completed my Master in Electrical and Computers Engineering with a major in Telecommunications and a specialization in Multimedia Communications. I then joined the Multimedia and Telecommunications Unit at INESC Porto, where I completed my Master Thesis on Multi-Object Tracking in Video Sequences.
