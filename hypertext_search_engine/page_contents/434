CTU  FEE  Admissions  Exchange students



Exchange students
The Faculty of Electrical Engineering (FEE) extends a warm welcome to all students who have decided to spend some time studying in Prague.
Our faculty is a part of the oldest and one of the largest technical universities in Central Europe. It is internationally acknowledged as an institution offering a wide range of study programmes taught in English as well as supporting international research projects.
We hope you find clear and helpful information on this website regarding the application procedure as well as other university services.
Apart from gaining a first-rate education, Prague is also a great place to live and as one of the most popular European capitals. It offers countless opportunities to enjoy your free time, whether you are a party animal, a solitary walker, a sports fan, a camera- clicking sightseer or a culture vulture. The entire team of international relations officers and I are happy to help you with all possible enquires. Join our International Students Club which is a lively international community of students ready to help you to get the best out of your stay here. I highly recommend joining the club and finding friends at the university through our Buddy programme before your actual arrival.
We will do our best to ensure that your stay at FEE CTU in Prague will be both academically and socially fulfilling! 
Looking forward to seeing you soon!





				Responsible person: 
				doc. Ing. Jiří Jakovenko, Ph.D.
