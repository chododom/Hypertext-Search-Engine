Examinations
Examinations form an essential part of your assessment at the faculty.  At the beginning of each course, the lecturer will give you detailed information about the examination procedure. The forms of examinations might differ course to course but the most common form of assessment at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering will be a written examination in the form of a test and/or an oral examination together with the presentation of a paper to test your knowledge as well as your presentation skills. The exam could follow a list of questions in a prepared format, or it could be a more informal and open discussion. In some courses you will be asked to prepare a group paper / project which is usually assessed during seminars towards the end of a course. Near the end of each course you will be given instructions with a timetable for exam period.
The preconditions for admittance to the final state examination:


Bachelor's study program: accumulation of 180 credits in the prescribed structure

Master's study program: accumulation of 120 credits in the prescribed structure
Final examination
All programmes lead towards The Final State Examination which consists of two parts, each with a separate evaluation:


Thesis defence - lasts about 20 minutes. The thesis is evaluated through the overall quality and significance of your written work.  Within your oral defence you should be able to summarize the main aims of the papers and give clear answers about your findings. After passing the oral defence you become a “candidate” for the degree if you pass with no more than one dissenting vote.

Oral examination in technical subjects - during your last semester of study you should receive a list of topics for the final examinations. On the day of your examination you will randomly draw a topic with a preparation time of about 30 minutes in order to prepare notes and comments for your drawn topics. After the “preparatory” time you will be invited to speak to the committee which might give you additional questions on your topics.
Final State Examinations are held twice a year, at the end of each semester. Students are examined by a committee that comprises of 5 academics from your home faculty as well as from external educational institutions.
Before your Final State Exam


Hand in two hardbound copies of your thesis and submit your electronic version to “Electronic Thesis and Dissertation”

Submit signed copies of the Agreement regarding the Terms of Use of the Qualification Thesis.

Fill in the Application Form for the Final State Examination and hand it in to the programme administrator

Double check that all your grades have been recorded

Meet the submission deadline! Late submissions cannot be accepted!
Termination of studies
Your studies are usually terminated by a successful completion of your study program by passing the final state examination.  
Your studies could be also terminated if:


you did not receive enough credits for your particular stage of study

you have decided to drop your studies
The termination of studies means that you are no longer a student at the faculty and thus cannot continue to go to classes, submit work, sit for an exam or use facilities for enrolled students.
In case you no longer wish to continue your studies, you need to inform the Study Office, either in person or by sending a registered letter and hand in your student card.
Nevertheless, we highly recommend you to talk to your tutor first before making the final decision to leave the faculty.
