CTU  FEE  Admissions  How to apply – Exchange students



How to apply – Exchange students
Thank you for your interest in studying at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, CTU in Prague. 
For visiting and exchange students we offer numerous courses in English and also research projects.
In order to apply for an exchange programme your home university has to recommend you as a student. So please talk to your Exchange Coordinator first. After we receive an authorised nomination letter we will contact you by email with a request to register online and fill in the application form which you have to return with all additional documents to the CTU international office. To help you with the procedure please see the detailed step by step application guide.
We recommend you to apply for the University accommodation early as the rooms are booked on a first come first served basis.
Are you coming to Prague from a non-EU country or with non-EU citizenship? In that case you will need to get through the visa procedure  once you receive the Letter of acceptance and Confirmation of accommodation.
We encourage you to get in touch with your peers from the International Students Club before arrival and take part in the Orientation week. It will make your arrival smoother and you will already have a couple of friends once you land in Prague.
The deadline for application forms for the winter term is May 15 and November 30 for the summer term. We cannot accept late applications!
The contact person to whom all documents regarding your study exchange has to be sent is Mrs. Lucie Bilová.
