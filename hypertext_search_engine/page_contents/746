BIE-SRC – Real-time Systems  
Annotation
Students will get basic knowledge in the theory of RTOS, formal instruments for design of such systems, applied software engineering, and security aspects that lead to quality improvement in software products. Students will also be able to solve a more complex task - time critical model controlling - in which they can use advantages of a graphical programming environment and further advanced tools for programming on RTOSs.
Lectures Program

Characteristis of real-time operating systems (RTOS), categorization.
RTOS, properties, types.
RTOS components and their functionality.
Task time scheduling, interrupts.
Handling of requests.
Memory and peripheral management.
UML language, diagrams for real-time.
[2] SDL language: blocks, processes, synchronization, state automata, communication, data, signals, variables.
Analysis, simulation, and code generation.
Validation and testing.
Fundamentals of design of complex systems.
Example analysis.

Labs Program

Acquainting with the RTOS and its development environment. Compilation, debugging, event viewer.
Task 1: mutexes, semaphores.
Task 2: message queues, timers.
Task 3: processes, shared memory.
Task 4: OS task scheduler.
Task 5: impact of memory access on the run time (cache, prefetching, ...).
[2] Simulation measurements.
Task 6 assignment - controlling a more complex system.
[3] Solving task 6.
Submission of task 6.
