Before Arrival 
DOCUMENTS TO TRAVEL WITH

Travel documents
    For both, EU citizens as well as third-country nationals, we would like to recommend traveling with passport and an ID card together.
Medical insurance
    Check your medical insurance contract if it also covers medical services at the Czech Republic and EU or apply for a new one. The agreed insurance benefit limit for one insurance event must be at least EUR 60 000, that being without an insurance retention on the amount of the given costs.
Confirmation of studies
    Please, keep with you a copy of confirmation of studies. You can use it before you will be enrolled.
Confirmation of your accommodation
    To check-in at the dormitory you will be asked to provide your booking confirmation.
Medicines and medical certificates
    If you have a history with certain medical conditions (e.g. asthma, allergies, etc.) please prepare all medical certificates before coming to Prague to help the local doctors diagnose you and provide a prescription.
Four passport size photographs
    After arrival you will be asked to provide photographs at the Study Department as well as for your university ID/ISIC card, dormitory ID, etc.
OTHER DOCUMENTS
Contact the Czech Embassy in your home country and ask about the requirements for legalising documents for use in the Czech Republic. Also enquire about the Apostille.
The Apostille is an official stamp authenticating public document for use abroad. In case you would like to retain the original document (e. g. diploma) make notarised copies. It’s cheaper and easier to bring all documents to Prague and then make a notarised copy at a local notary or a CzechPoint service office before getting the required documents translated here in Prague.
Lastly, you have to translate all documents into Czech language with a certified court translator (in Czech “soudní tlumočník”).
MONEY

Bank cards
    All types of MasterCard and VISA cards are widely accepted in shops, supermarkets, restaurants, at petrol stations, reception desks, etc. You may encounter problems using a Maestro, American Express, Diners Club International, JCB Card, Mir, Union Pay and other cards.
Cash (for the first days)
    For the first days after arrival you will need cash for various transactions. We recommend you prepare about CZK 12 000 (approx. EUR 500 or USD 600) in cash in advance or at least withdraw/exchange about CZK 1 200 (approx. EUR 50 or USD 60) at the airport before heading into town.
Czech Republic is a member of the European Union, but it is not part of the Eurozone and the official currency is the Czech crown (or “koruna”). Some vendors may accept Euros, but the exchange rate is unfavourable. There are cash machines (ATMs) available throughout Prague but be aware of withdrawal charges as they vary with the specifics of a transaction. 
After Arrival 
FIRST STEPS AFTER ARRIVAL

Get a 72-hour public transport pass
    You can buy this pass at the airport, any train or bus station. You can pay with cash as well as by card.
Register at the dormitory
    Make sure you have CZK 300 in cash for dormitory insurance. Please, inform your dormitory Manager about your arrival date (and time) in advance.
Study enrolment
    After arrival you have also to register at the Study Department (in Czech “Studijní oddělení”). Make sure you have all important documents including the photographs.
Get your university ID/ISIC card
    To get your university ID/ISIC card, please, visit the Department for University Identity Card Issuing at the Student House (in Czech “Studentský dům”).
Register at the foreign police
    After arrival you are obliged to register within 3 business at the Foreign Police. This requirement is optional for students registered at the dormitory. We are recommending all third-country nationals also to register at the foreign police to get the stamp with a “Czech address”. You will need it to open a bank account, register to the library, etc.
Open a bank account
    Open an account at the local bank with a debit card to get scholarships and pay invoices. Make sure you have your university ID/ISIC card or confirmation of studies with you to get special offers.
Get your pre-paid public transport pass
    First of all, apply for the Prague Municipal Card called “Lítačka”, which serves as your public transport card, Municipal Library card, etc. This card will be really very useful! Then you will be able to buy on it pre-paid public transport passes for 30 or 90 day as well as for 5 or 10 months.
Get a Czech sim-card
    You can also save money using the local pre-paid or contract sim-card. Your student ID/ISIC Card will make you eligible for discounts and special offers.

CLOTHES
Czech Republic is a country of four seasons. It is good to be prepared for the season in which you are going to arrive too. Winter months (November to early March) can be very cold and frosty and the temperature may fall (and stay) below zero. So a warm jacket, hat and gloves could be an advantage. Spring and autumn is quite mild and summer can be very hot.
