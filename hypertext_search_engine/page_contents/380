Scientists from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering will help research the union of Journalism and Artificial Intelligence  

 





Publication date: 2019/02/04‘Transformation of ethical aspects with the emergence of Artificial Intelligence Journalism (UI)’ is a new project that builds on the interdisciplinary concept of journalism and computer science. Collaborators on this project are The Department of Journalism at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Charles University, the Department of Computer Science at CTU Electrical Engineering Faculty, Department of Information Technology at the Faculty of Applied Sciences of the West Bohemian University in Pilsen and Czech Press Agency. The primary objective of the research is the emergence of a UI system that will generate texts for further use in journalism.
The project linking journalism and computer science counts on the emergence and application of a system for authentication, analysis and creation of news content through artificial intelligence.

Researchers will also look into the subsequent research on transformation of selected attributes of journalism ethics in era of artificial intelligence journalism, such as content verification using classic methods and AI support, the use of AI - generated content and the associated ethical conflict between speed and accuracy, and changing the role of journalists in newsrooms where AI systems are applied.

Even after the creation of working algorithm, field research will be carried out with the editors. It will focus on selected attributes of changes in journalism ethics in the era of artificial intelligence. Consequently, research will compare the speed of creation, accuracy and authentication processes of news content produced with current editorial practices, and by means of artificial intelligence in the future.

The project was created within the framework of the 2nd public competition of the Program for the Support of Applied Social Sciences and Humanities Research, Experimental Development and Innovations of Technology ( the ‘ETA’ program) of Technological Agency of the Czech Republic
