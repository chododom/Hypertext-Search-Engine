BIE-OSY – Operating Systems  
Annotation
Students understand the classical theory of operating systems (OS) in addition to the knowledge gained in the BI-UOS module. They get a solid knowledge of OS kernels, processes and threads implementations. They understand the problems of race conditions and principles and algorithms for critical sections, thread scheduling, resource allocation, deadlocks. They understand the techniques of managing virtual memory, principles and architectures of disks and disk arrays, file systems and peripheral devices. They gain basic knowledge necessary for developing system applications or for system administration. They are able to design and implement simple multithreaded applications.
