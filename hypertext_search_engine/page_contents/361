Computational Neuroscience research group
 visit group website
We focus on studying the physiology and pathophysiology of the human brain, mostly those of patients suffering from Parkinson disease (PD) or dystonia, and treated with the deep brain stimulation (DBS). By analyzing and modeling single neuron recordings and fMRI data, our aim is to better understand how the brain and DBS work. We also develop methods of data processing, transformation, and analysis.





Nature Inspired Technologies group
 visit group website
Current technology offers number of sophisticated new sensors and devices (e.g. mobile phones, tiny cameras, brain stimulators) inviting for integration into smart man-machine systems, original medical devices, interactive assistive or rehabilitation tools and assistive environments. Our aim is to design and create such interoperating systems having in mind the needs of their intended users, be it medical professionals, patients, computer users or challenged persons.
