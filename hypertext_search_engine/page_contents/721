AgentFly is an agent-based system for a large scale air traffic simulation. It is able to simulate tens of thousands airplanes in detail, e.g. to compute fuel consumption. It also models cognitive behavior of air traffic controllers to simulate their activities and workload. The AgentFly can be used to simulate complete air traffic over US to predict future air traffic

Project




Agent-based algorithms for road traffic autonomous support systems: Project focusses on massive autonomous traffic system simulations mainly for the purposes of development of algorithms for autonomous traffic systems and multi-agent optimization of transportation logistics. Individual research results are cross-validated to ensure their scalability, reliability, fidelity and applicability in unified realistic autonomous traffic system.

Project




In Computation Game Theory we study and design new algorithms for finding optimal behavior in finite sequential scenarios, where agents have to deal with limited information, uncertainty, and competing opponents. Typical examples include classical card and board games, scenarios from the security domain, or auctions

Adaptive Informative Path Planning in Autonomous Data Collection in Dynamic Unstructured Environments
The proposed aims to develop new adaptive planning algorithms for robotic information gathering in unstructured environments.
We plan to leverage on combination of active sensing, planning, and learning techniques to design a unifying adaptive autonomous data collection planning framework to deal with motion and sensor uncertainties in a dynamic and partially known environment. We propose to generalize the autonomous data collection planning to improve performance of the data collection mission by adaptive re-planning based on new information gathered during the mission. In particular we aim to propose and design:1) specific autonomous data collection planning algorithms for simultaneous determination of sensing locations and trajectory generation2) adaptive planning algorithm for on-line refinement of traversability cost in dynamic rough terrains for a hexapod walking robot3) to establish complex analysis and empirical evaluation of the developed solutions.
