ontinue your studies at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering after your high school studies you would need to submit a leaving certificate as well as the transcript of records and validate your previous education by Czech educational authorities.
How does the recognition process of secondary education work?
You will need both documents officially translated into Czech by a sworn translator and have your documents notarized.  You could either do so in your home country (the Czech embassy in your home country can usually provide contacts for sworn translators and a notary) or you can have your documents translated and notarized in the Czech Republic. 
The validation of your previous education is done by Czech educational authorities. This process is called “nostrifikace”.  The power to validate international high school leaving certificates has been delegated to Prague City Hall, Department of Education, Youth and Sport.
Once you provide a notarized Transcript of studies together with the leaving certificate, the educational authorities have 60 days to assess and validate your documents. The validation process also depends on the country where your original diploma was issued:


If your documents were issued in the countries which have the mutual agreement about recognition of high school diplomas with the Czech Republic, Prague City Hall will provide you with the Certificate of Equivalence. These countries are Afghanistan, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Hungary, Germany, Poland and Slovenia.

If your diploma was issued in other country than those mentioned above, the Czech educational authorities would need to evaluate whether your high school diploma is equivalent to a Czech high school diploma. If they found that your record of study achievements differs in content and scope from the Czech requirements for achieving a leaving certificate, you might be asked to take an additional exam.
To sum up, you need to provide the Prague City Hall with the following documents:


The Application form (available from Prague City Hall website)

Notarized copy of your school-leaving certificate and transcript of studies together with a sworn translation

Pay the fee for validation: CZK 3000
Please note! All new students should provide the faculty with validated documents at registration (usually late September). That said, as this process might be difficult to do from home, the faculty can issue a pre-acceptance letter for you and you would go through the process when you are already in Prague but it is necessary to complete the process no later than the December of the year you start to study your programme. If you won’t be able to complete the process on time, you cannot continue your studies and the university enrolment will be terminated.
Useful links
If you have any specific questions you can also contact one of the following associations:
The Association for Integration and migration provides free legal, social and psychosocial counselling to foreigners living in the Czech Republic.
META the Association for Opportunities of Young Migrants, which provide foreigners with counselling and educational services and support educators in their work with their students. Our clients include both foreigners, regardless of their residence status, and educators working at all grade-levels and types of schools.
- Students applying after previous university education

Notarized copy of the degree certificate and Transcript of records
If you have decided to study at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and you have already achieved a degree from another university abroad, you have to submit a notarized copy of your diploma as well as a transcript of records issued by your previous educational institution and have your degree validated by the Czech Technical University,Department for Study and Student Affairs. The process of validating your previous degree is also called „nostrification“and it takes approximately 30 days.
How does the process of nostrification work?


Submit an application form  

Together with the Application form for the recognition of documents you have to provide the university with officially verified copies (see the note below) of your degree certificate and Transcript of records.You will need both documents officially translated either into English or Czech language by a sworn translator and have your documents notarized.

Send all required documents in paper to:
Eva Veselá
        Rektorát ČVUT
        Odbor pro studium a studentské záležitosti
        Zikova 4
        166 36 Praha 6
        Czech Republic
Phone:  +420 22435 3359, e-mail: eva.vesela@cvut.cz.
Students from some countries have to provide so called "higher verified" documentation, which means that your original documents must not only be sealed by the institution you are coming from and notarized but also verified by a designed authority in your home country (usually the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Ministry of Education). This special seal is called an apostille. After getting an apostille you need the true copies of your original documents notarized. If you are not sure whether you are coming from country with such regulations, you can contact either Ms. Eva Veselá from the CTU rectorate at eva.vesela@cvut.cz or Hana Chmelenská, the Head of International Relations at hana.chmelenska@fel.cvut.cz and they will be happy to help you.
