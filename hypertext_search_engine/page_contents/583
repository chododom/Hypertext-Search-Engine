Synopsis:


Information security is very often considered as one of main objectives to secure targets of information processing. However,
                  to focus on this info security as a matter of protection of IT systems against viruses, malware etc. very often means misunderstanding
                  and underestimating of real threats which are around us and which are more dangerous then viruses and other malware. The necessity
                  to continue with business after disaster is also slightly ignored. International standards which are focused on informatics
                  and information security just during last years started to anticipate necessity of risk management. There is no commonly accepted
                  methodology used for this task. Threats which are currently possible to see worldwide, invoke pressures to prepare plans for
                  business continuity management even in the case of dramatic political changes, natural disasters etc.
               


Requirements:


No special prerequisities.


Syllabus of lectures:


1. Risk definition, information materiality
2. Threats in informatics
3. Risk management methodology
4. Threats category and threats catalogue
5. Risk lifecycle - identification
6. Risk lifecycle - Threats identification in company
7. Risk lifecycle - Evaluation, mitigation
8. Risk lifecycle - mitigation, checking and risk register
9. Organization and risk/security management, (RACI)
10. Return of investment in informatics
11. Business Continuity Management
12. Archiving, legal requirements on informatics I
13. Archiving, legal requirements on informatics II


Syllabus of tutorials:

Study Objective:


Lectures should provide information about definitions, threats and vulnerabilities identification, methodology used to evaluation
                  of threats, threats catalogues, Business Impact Analysis, return of investment, disaster recovery centers and legal requirements
                  in specified area.
               
Students also should understand how to negotiate with company management to fulfill their IT requirements etc. Management
                  ought to be convinced about reasons for investment but managers are usually not technicians.
