Alumni
ELEKTRA, the Association of Alumni and Friends of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the Czech Technical University in Prague, was founded in 1991. Like other associations of engineers, ELEKTRA brings together alumni and friends of the University, regardless of their current status. Individuals and companies can be the members of the Association. Our aim is to provide support for the fast development and activities of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering (FEE). ELEKTRA is an informal association for those who strive to promote the good reputation of the school and its interests. We want to share experiences in and out of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Furthermore, to support the scientific and technical research altogether with technical studies for the 3rd millennium. Our mission is to facilitate meetings and guarantee active participation for all alumni members, and to set up a unique platform for exchanging practical experience and keeping abreast of what is new at the faculty.
