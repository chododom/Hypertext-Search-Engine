About

                    We are a group of researchers from Artificial Intelligence Center at CTU in Prague working on algorithms enabling more efficient and more sustainable future urban mobility. 

                        See below for an non-exhaustive list of research themes related to smart urban mobility that are pursued within the center.

Research Themes







On-Demand Mobility









						We are developing models that provide insights into the performance of on-demand transportation 
                        systems and use them to estimate the impact of their large-scale deployment. Further, we are 
                        looking in the potential of advanced optimization techniques, automation, ride-sharing and 
                        market-based mechanisms to achieve affordable, efficient, and congestion-free urban traffic.

Electromobility








						We work on novel route planning and fleet management algorithms improving the experience 
                        electric mobility users. At the level of users of electric vehicles, we provide intelligent 
                        navigation systems that suggest adaptations in the travel plan to allow more efficient charging.
                        At the fleet level, we develop management tools that help optimising fleet operations, 
                        maximising battery lifetime and minimising charging costs.

AgentPolis: Urban Mobility Simulator








						We are developing and maintaining an agent-based micro-simulator of urban traffic called 
                        AgentPolis. The simulator can be used to perform large-scale "what-if" simulation studies 
                        involving different modes of transport such as private cars, on-demand cars, public transport 
                        etc. Agentpolis is particularly useful for evaluation of different fleet management strategies
                        in on-demand systems.

Transportation Demand Modeling








						We are developing a model of transportation demand for the agglomeration of Prague, Czech 
                        Republic and Brno, Czech Republic. We use activity-based models trained on data from various 
                        sources. The resulting model is able to generate large, highly-granular synthetic trip data 
                        covering the entire population of the city agglomeration.

Multi-modal Route Planning








						We are extending routing and journey planning algorithms to support the full spectrum of 
                        mobility services available in modern cities, combining individual and collective, 
                        fixed-schedule as well on-demand means of transport while taking into account individual 
                        user preferences and availability of transport services and resources.

Light Personal Transport








						Bicycles and other light transportation modes represent a sustainable alternative to private 
                        automobiles. We are developing specialized, multi-criteria route planner for cyclist that 
                        considers aspects such as elevation, surface quality, or traffic intensity along the route.
