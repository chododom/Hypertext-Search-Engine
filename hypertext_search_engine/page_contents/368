Like other associations of engineers, ELEKTRA brings together alumni and friends of the University, regardless of their current status. Individuals and companies can be the members of the Association. Our aim is to provide support for the fast development and activities of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering (FEE).

Furthermore, to support the scientific and technical research altogether with technical studies for the 3rd millennium.
