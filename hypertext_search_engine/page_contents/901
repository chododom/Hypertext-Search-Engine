Hackers are really smart ... )Deception (How to deceive your opponent and not get fooled?)Adversarial Machine Learning (Even a machine can learn ... be one step ahead!)Coalitional Game Theory (feature importance using coalitional game theory)Methods ... this is what we doequilibrium computation algorithms for dynamic games (extensive-form games, stochastic games)counterfactual regret minimization and continual resolving (DeepStack)solving games with continuous action spacescoalitional game theoryTools ... every Jedi needs his light-saber  we prove stuff (showing theoretical guarantees and/or limitations of our algorithms)we implement and experimentally validate our algorithms (Java, C++, TensorFlow)domain-independent implementation of all our algorithms (hg clone http://jones.felk.cvut.cz/repo/gtlibrary)Play a game... work on difficult and interesting challengesBachelors/Masters projectsPhD positionspart-time positions... collaborate with other researchers/industryprojects and active collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, UTEP, University of Alberta/DeepMind, IST Austriaprojects with TrendMicro, AVASTWhich game specifically can you play?... only examples, you can propose your own design an algorithm for the Scotland Yard board game (e.g., improve our domain-independent algorithm for this class of games)design an algorithm for blind chess (Kriegspiel)combine planners (e.g., A*) with game-theoretic algorithms (planning in an adversarial environment)combine classifiers (e.g., simple image recognition, anomaly detection in computer network traffic) with game-theoretic algorithms (adversarial machine learning)win over humans (build a mathematical model for human behavior for some game, design an algorithm that exploits human irrationality)do the theory/math for combination of classifiers and game theory Contact us:          viliam.lisy@fel.cvut.cz         bosansky@fel.cvut.cz Made with the new Google Sites, an effortless way to create beautiful sites.Report abuseThis site uses cookies from Google to deliver its services and to analyze traffic.
