thors just for reasons of honour or favour, or as research supervisors, unless they not meet the conditions for authorship. If there are well-founded reasons for mentioning them, the above-mentioned workers should be named in the "acknowledgments" in the publication;
2. Plagiarism
Plagiarism involves copying or publishing someone else.s research results and development work without citing the source of information; or using other sources as a core or major part of the publication.
3. Redundant publications
Redundant publications are papers which overlap with one already published. These papers are written by the same authors with minimal differences in the text. Redundant publications contain the same data, though there may be different units, yields etc. There is only a small difference between the original publication and the "redundant" publication in names, abstract and order of authors.
An extreme case of a redundant publication is a duplicate of the original work by the same author.
Developing research results published in conference anthologies and in "preprints" (which may be just short informative notices) of regular publications are not considered to be redundant publications.
Article 2
Obligations of workers (researchers) and students of FEE CTU
1. Researchers and students of FEE CTU as authors or co-authors of a publication:

do not plagiarize. They acknowledge the scientific contributions of their predecessors and colleagues to the question studied to which the article is directly linked; when citing findings and results gained by other authors, a clear reference is made to the respective sources;
also cite important works which are contrary to their own research results and conclusions;
will take measures to correct any substantial mistake that they find in their published data, for example by publishing errata or by taking other appropriate steps;
make efforts to avoid the practice of redundant publications and fragmenting or duplicating research results to multiple journals or publications to the detriment of quality and clarity;
avoid getting their own work cited in other publications by means of utilitarian agreements with other authors to cite each others. work purposely.

2. An FEE CTU worker in the role of a supervisor or a teacher:

admits students and research co-workers after objectively evaluating their intellectual, ethical and personal characteristics;
when leading a research team, pays heed to correctness and openness in mutual communication and avoids any kind of unjustified autocratic style of leadership;
encourages students to think independently and critically, and respects students. rights to freely and openly express their opinions on research;
assesses her/his students and colleagues according to the results achieved and treats them equitably, not requiring work which is his/her own responsibility, and not setting tasks which might be beyond the student.s capabilities;
acknowledges students or colleagues as co-authors of the publication if their creative work contributed to the published results;
supports and promotes the scientific and academic publishing activities of his/her subordinates or students as well as their professional development;
does not accept any kind of unethical behaviour which might have a negative impact on students in education or in research work;
deduces consequences from any unethical behaviour of subordinates and students.

These principles and policies for scientific and publishing activities were written and approved by the Scientific Council of FEE CTU in Prague on November 22, 2006.
