				5. 10. 2018


					This project will examine conditional adversarial networks as a solution to the problem of automatic colorization and stylization of hand-drawn sketches. During training time a neural network receives pairs of colored images and corresponding edge maps and learns to synthesize the colored image given the edge map. During test time the goal is to generalize to synthesis of colored images given hand-drawn sketches, while respecting the underlined contours. The project will follow the road-map of the pix2pix (demo: https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/) approach, while it will focus on learning several coloring styles from different training domains (artwork, cartoon, clipart, etc.) to be applied on a hand-drawn object or scene.

1 semester / Bachelor or master
Department of Cybernetics
				11. 7. 2018


					Algorithms ECGA (extended compact genetic algorithm) and BOA (Bayesian optimization algorithm) are population-based optimization algorithms. They are among the most powerfull methods for optimization of complex black-box optimization problems with binary representation. Each generation they build a model of the structure of dependencies among individual solution components. The model learning is a time consuming operation. For ECGA, an efficiency enhancement was proposed recently that allows to simplify and accelerate the learning without any negative effect on the algorithm performance.

					Genetic programming is an evolutionary method for searching for algorithms that solve certain problem, or for searching a structured description of certain system, e.g. in the form of a mathematical expression. Evaluation of a candidate solution is usually done with respect to a big set of test cases which is time consuming. That's why the so-called fitness predictors are used.

3D reconstruction of historic buildings interiors from a structured light camera

				11. 7. 2018


					Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expanding from open outdoor environments into more constrained indoor locations thanks to improvements in accuracy and precision of localization, navigation and control algorithms in recent years. New possibilities for deployment of autonomous UAV swarms into indoor environments emerge, leading to the development of high-level mission-oriented algorithms. Our team is in particular interested in mapping and documenting of historic buildings to assess the condition of the ceiling, murals, statues, stained glass, etc. An accurate and detailed 3D model of the historic buildings is needed for arranging restoration projects, measuring certain dimensions of the interior, and also for planning of further UAV missions. The solution will use structured light approach, which consists of projecting a near-infrared (IR) pattern of parallel lines that are registered by two cameras mounted on a fixed baseline. The depth in the image is estimated from the deformation of the narrow-band pattern. The goal of this project is to autonomously navigate a UAV equipped with a structured light camera through a historic building to capture the interior by laser scans completely. The solution will involve onboard decision making and trajectory replanning that will guide the UAV to yet unmapped areas while simultaneously avoiding collisions with obstacles. When the whole interior is mapped, the dataset obtained during the flight will be processed, and triangular meshes will be built to generate a realistic 3D surface model of the interior.

Autonomous laser-scan-based relative navigation for UAVs

					Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expanding from open outdoor environments into more constrained indoor locations thanks to improvements in accuracy and precision of localization, navigation and control algorithms in recent years. New possibilities for deployment of autonomous UAV swarms into indoor environments emerge, leading to the development of high-level mission-oriented algorithms. The community achieved significant progress in the development of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms that estimate the position of the robot in a gradually built map. However, it has turned out, that the position estimate in the map is not necessary for particular tasks, and the position relative to obstacles currently detected by the onboard sensors is more important. One of such missions is the so-called search-and-rescue, in which the UAV has to find a specific object (or person) in an unknown cluttered environment. The goal of this project is to develop a navigation method that accepts a user input consisting of approximate direction of the searched object, and the UAV autonomously flies in the specified direction while modifying its trajectory to avoid obstacles in its vicinity. The area around the UAV is continuously scanned by a rotating laser rangefinder (LIDAR) that generates 360° planar laser scans of the surroundings. The solution should use the most recent laser scan to obtain the nest control input by employing potential field planning or adaptive model predictive control. The mission is accomplished when the searched object is detected by a passive camera or an emergency signal detecting device.

					Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are expanding from open outdoor environments into more constrained indoor locations thanks to improvements in accuracy and precision of localization, navigation and control algorithms in recent years. New possibilities for deployment of autonomous UAV swarms into indoor environments emerge, leading to the development of high-level mission-oriented algorithms. Our team is in particular interested in mapping and documenting of historic buildings to assess the condition of the ceiling, murals, statues, stained glass, etc. The historics and restorers need high-quality detailed images to evaluate the unreachable parts of the buildings for which the UAV is the ideal platform that saves money and time that would otherwise be spent on building scaffoldings to reach the areas of interest. The goal of this project is to develop a technique for documenting the UAV interior using a team of UAVs equipped with cameras. The high quality and resolution of the images will be achieved by stitching multiple close-up images taken by all members of the UAV team. Assuming the approximate positions of the UAVs are known, the camera images taken from a close vicinity of the documented object can be stitched together into a large and detailed image by matching image features. The optimal trajectory for all members of the team has to be planned so that the whole documented object is captured with sufficient overlap between the images to allow stitching into a high-resolution composite image. The time spent on capturing the images has to be minimized since the flight time of the UAVs is constrained by their battery capacity.

New possibilities for deployment of autonomous UAV swarms into indoor environments emerge, leading to the development of high-level mission-oriented algorithms. Our team is in particular interested in mapping and documenting of historic buildings to assess the condition of the ceiling, murals, statues, stained glass, etc. When a UAV is operating in indoor environments, it is vital to prevent collisions of the UAV with obstacles with arbitrary shape. The UAV can be equipped with multiple sensors estimating the distance of an obstacle from the UAV. The sensors are working on different principles (LIDARs and passive cameras) to generate a computer representation of the surroundings of the UAV. While the LIDARs provide an accurate and precise distance to the obstacles, they provide measurements only in the sensor plane. A monocular camera, on the other hand, can detect obstacles in the whole area in front of the UAV, but cannot provide depth information. The goal of this project is to develop a collision avoidance system. The technique will segment the image, to obtain the position estimate of objects in the axes of camera plane. The distance from the UAV to the objects will be estimated by finding correspondences between the objects in the image and laser scans. The trajectory of the UAV will then be modified to avoid the collision with the obstacle.

New possibilities for deployment of autonomous UAV swarms into indoor environments emerge, leading to the development of high-level mission-oriented algorithms. Our team is in particular interested in mapping and documenting of historic buildings to assess the condition of the ceiling, murals, statues, stained glass, etc. Despite the advanced localization methods, a situation that could lead to a collision of the UAV with a static or dynamic obstacle might occur due to localization algorithm failure, sensor not detecting the obstacle, etc. The goal of this project is to design, build and implement a system that will serve as a low-level, last-resort collision avoidance solution. Such a system sometimes referred to as a virtual bumper, will activate when the safety area defined by a sphere around the UAV is compromised. The UAV would quickly, but smoothly modify its trajectory to avoid the collision by an evasive maneuver with parameters depending on the time to potential collision. The development of the hardware part, consisting of a set of cheap ultrasound sensors mounted on the frame of the UAV, will be a crucial part of the solution.

The goal of this project is to combine the environment representations from LIDAR and passive monocular camera. Features will be extracted in both image and laser scan, and correspondences between them found. The camera images will then be mapped on the surface consisting of triangular meshes constructed from the laser scans.

Our team is in particular interested in mapping and documenting of historic buildings to assess the condition of the ceiling, murals, statues, stained glass, etc. A reliable position estimate of the UAV is needed for all indoor autonomous flights. Since the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) services are generally not available indoor, the UAV must be localized using onboard sensors only. One of the sensors that are widely used for localization of UAVs, is the rotating laser rangefinder (LIDAR). Two principal approaches exist for laser-scan-based localization: scan matching techniques and feature-based methods. The goal of this project will be to develop a feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system. The system will read laser scans from the LIDAR, process them, extract stable features, find corresponding features in the simultaneously built map to estimate the current position of the UAV in the map. A loop closure detection algorithm will be employed to correct the position drift after returning to a previously visited part of the map.

One of the sensors that are widely used for localization of UAVs are the passive stereo cameras. While cameras work well in outdoor environments, their deployments indoor is problematic, due to insufficient light. The solution is to use structured light approach, which consists of projecting a near-infrared (IR) pattern of parallel lines that are registered by two cameras mounted on a fixed baseline. The depth in the image is estimated from the deformation of the narrow-band pattern. The goal of this project is to develop a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system based on a structured light depth camera. The system will read the depth image from the camera, extract stable features, and find corresponding features in the simultaneously built map to estimate the current position of the UAV in the map.

					Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for face recognition requires large sets of annotated face examples. Manual annotation of faces is laborious work and results are often imprecise. The goal of this project is to implement a system that can learn CNNs from weakly annotated images that can be created by an automated process not requiring humans. As a case study the system will be applied to learn CNN for age and gender recognition from weakly annotated IMDB database that contains 300k faces of movie celebrities. Each image in the database is annotated by the name, biological age and gender of the captured celebrity. However, the images can contain multiple faces and its is not know to which face the annotation should be linked (see example image below). The implemented system should establish the missing link between the images and the annotations.

				11. 7. 2018


					The diagnostics of multiple myeloma (a type of bone marrow cancer) uses blood plasma tests as well as CT images of large bones (femurs in this case). From the methodical point of view, these data represent a situation to be found more often in next years -- we don't have fully annotated images at voxel level, since this work is very time consuming, but are provided only with a 'global' label (healthy / diseased), which comes naturally from the diagnosis. By means of Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) we are able to reach reasonable precision in the classification. However, the interesting question how a deep-learning system will perform is still without answer. The aim of this work is to implement a selected CNN architecture, or to compare multiple architectures, and evaluate it's performance against the current system. This work thus brings the opportunity to learn more about the newest methods in machine learning, to improve own programming skills as well as to get in touch with the field of medical imaging and computer assisted diagnosis.

				12. 4. 2017


					Nash equilibrium (NE) is the best known solution concept in game theory, however, NE does not exactly correspond to the way people make their decisions in competitive scenarios. Therefore, a number of alternative solution concepts was designed, such as quantal response equilibrium, or cognitive hierarchy models. Until now, only a limited focus has been given on studying these solution concepts in the domain of extensive-form games together with the computational aspect. Therefore, the task is to:
1) Study alternative behavioral game-theoretic solution concepts in the domain of extensive-form games.
2) Investigate existing algorithms for finding these solution concepts in extensive-form games.
3) Analyze and design a modification of existing algorithms using an iterative double-oracle approach that is successfully used for computing NE.
4) Implement designed algorithms and experimentally evaluate the performance against human participants.

				11. 7. 2018


					The negative impact of transaction on implementation of energy efficiency measures has been acknowledged and supported by a number of studies. Transaction costs can hinder implementation of energy efficiency policy measures or even prevent them from being implemented at all. Yet, transaction costs have not been systematically taken into account when designing energy efficiency policies and have not been systematically evaluated ex post, either. Therefore, the information on overall effectiveness of (public) programmes tends to be incomplete. The goal of the work is to analyse a selected energy efficiency or renewable energy policy instrument from the view point of transaction costs and to compare the results with existing studies. The preliminary steps of the task are: 1. Overview of the methods used to analyse transaction costs in energy efficiency or renewable energy policy instruments, 2. Methodology, 3. Analysis of transaction costs in a selected energy efficiency or renewable energy policy instrument, 4. Comparison with existing studies RequirementsBasics in energy efficiency, basics in renewable energy sources, basics in (energy) economics

Functional MRI of hypercapnia data
prof. Dr. Ing. Jan Kybic
1 semester / Bachelor or master
Department of Cybernetics
				11. 7. 2018


					Hypercapnia is a condition of increased presence of carbon dioxide in the blood. Normal reaction of brain to this condition is vessel dilation that will increase the blood ﬂow in the brain in order to compensate for the decreased presence of oxygen in blood. This processes can be monitored over time using a special MRI sequence called BOLD. The BOLD sequence is sensitive to the level of oxygen in blood and increased oxygen concentration shows as increased signal in the images. Hypercapnia BOLD imaging can used to study the vasoreactivy of vessels to the ﬂuctuating level of carbon dioxide in blood. It can be used to identify brain regions with non-standard reaction and as such to identify problematic vessels that may contain stenos or some other vascular pathology. The hypercapnia is usually induced by letting the subjects breath air with increased carbon dioxide concentrations during MRI examination. In our data, we have used several periods of controlled breatholds which is more convenient for use in clinical practice. This, however, brings additional issues in data evaluation as the patients are not always capable to dutifully follow the protocol. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate clinical data from 50+ patients obtained during one or more sessions. The brain of each patient is supposed to contain normal regions and it may contain also pathological regions. The time course of BOLD signal in each patient needs to be examined ﬁrst to identify what is the normal reaction for each patient (as being close to the expected response). Subsequently, the whole brain of each patient needs to be studied to identify if there are regions with no reaction and with pathological reaction. The result of the automatic analysis of the hypercapnia fMRI data will be compared with clinical ﬁndings and the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the automatic method and the BOLD examination will be assessed. Data and clinical ﬁndings will be supplied by University hospital in Dresden. The results will be evaluated in close collaboration with medical doctors from the hospital. RequirementsThe aplicant is expected to visit Dresden regularly. The applicant is expected to be ﬂuent in English and have good programming skills in Matlab. Willingness to learn basic principles of fMRI and BOLD imaging as well as to learn the basic medical background of the problem is expected.

Magnetic particle imaging - using automatically calibrated test targets
prof. Dr. Ing. Jan Kybic
1 semester / Bachelor or master
Department of Cybernetics
				11. 7. 2018


					Magnetic particle imaging is a recent imaging techniques, which can visualized tiny magnetic particles with high spatial resolution. The bottleneck is the calibration, which is currently performed by moving a point target around the acquisition region. The calibration can be speeded up by using several targets, with known spatial structure. We shall attempt to develop an algorithm which could at the same time identify the spatial structure of the calibration target and the motion of the pattern, simplifying the procedure considerably.

prof. Dr. Ing. Jan Kybic
1 semester / Bachelor or master
Department of Cybernetics
				11. 7. 2018


					In MRI, The T1 relaxation time of brain tissue can be measured separately in each voxel from the signal recovery after saturation measured at multiple times. This information can be used to provide brain segmentation with good accuracy without using any prior knowledge about brain topology. What has not been studied yet is the optimal settings of the acquisition times. The inﬂuence of more dense sampling and/or presence of noise in the data on the accuracy and systematic error of the segmentation needs to be evaluated. The obtained segmentation will be used for correcting partial volume eﬀect in perfusion MRI measurement. The real data will be provided by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden Rossendorf. RequirementsThe student should learn the basic principles of MR imaging and study the algorithm for brain segmentation from T1 signal recovery, design a simulated experiment and analyze the inﬂuence of noise and sampling pattern on accuracy and systematic errors in the segmentation, test the ideal sampling pattern on real data, and optionally demonstrate improvement of the ideal sampling on perfusion MRI.

					Given two images of the same scene but from different modalities, the task is to find their common segmentation. This problem is encountered for example in multimodality imaging, or as a subtask of iterative segmentation/registration. One possible formulation is that we want to approximate as well ass possible the target image using a segmentation and an appearance model for each class. We shall study various variations of this idea, e.g. how the approximation quality should be measured and how the resulting optimization should be performed.

					Hyperspectral imaging is a modern technique used in many application (natural science,  remote sensing, etc.). One of the crucial tasks is compression of acquired images and preparing for the processing. The project is focused on this part. The first step will be an introduction to state of the art of the compression algorithm of hyperspectral images and analyse of the statistical parameters acquired images. The main part of work will be devoted to design novel coder parameters based on PCA. RequirementsSignal processing course,   Calculus, linear algebra, image processing,  MATLAB
				 

Preservers in Quantum Information Theory
prof. RNDr. Jan Hamhalter, CSc.
1 semester 
Department of Mathematics
				11. 4. 2017


					Recently many new results on preservers of important quantities in quantum information theory such as mutual quantum information and entropy have appeared. However, many open and challenging questions in this area remain. In the project proposed we would like to concentrate on characterizing maps on quantum systems preserving important information metrics. The method will be based on studying existing methods in the literature and own investigation of the properties of quantum information for finite dimensional spaces. The work should result in a treatment and possibly in journal publication. RequirementsStrong background in Linear Algebra and Calculus.

Rolling shutter benchmark

					CMOS sensors that are used in vast majority of today’s consumer cameras, smartphones etc. use the rolling shutter (RS) mechanism to capture images. The key difference is that with the global shutter, the entire image is exposed to the light at once, whereas when using the RS the individual image rows (or columns) are captured at different times. When a RS camera moves while capturing the image, several types of distortion such as smear, skew or wobble appear. A perspective camera model is no longer valid in this case and that can be a problem when using methods assuming this model. Recently several algorithms for calibrating RS cameras have been proposed. These algorithms are usually evaluated on a very limited set of images (videos) without a ground truth. While there exist many benchmark datasets with ground truth camera calibrations and positions for perspective cameras, such datasets for RS cameras are still missing. The goal of this project is to create a benchmark dataset for RS cameras. The student/students will collect images/videos for different camera setups (a single RS camera, a stereo rig, two cameras with different rolling shutter directions or different frame rates, different types of camera movements (translations, rotations) during the image exposure….). Ground truth calibrations will be obtained using standard calibration methods, using a global shutter camera, and a controlled motion. For bachelor/master thesis the student will evaluate different state-of-the-art methods for RS calibration on the new proposed dataset. Based on the obtained results, the student will try to address challenging configurations (degenerate configurations) for different RS models. RequirementsMatlab, basic knowledge of calibration procedures
