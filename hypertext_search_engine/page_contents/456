he middle of the city, on top of the Strahov hill, it is more than a complex of buildings - it's a strong student community, willing to help the incomer in every situation.
The city itself, Prague, is truly a wonderful, magical place. I felt in love with it, and hundreds of times I found myself just wandering around, slightly lost, discovering amazing views and mysterious passages. The most important thing, though, is that I really felt at home -the city is very cosy, friendly and nice in every other way.
Also, I see Prague as a musical city. Dvořák, Smetana, Mozart - and many others - lived and composed here, and this can't be unnoticed - the music is everywhere: in concert halls, theatres and venues (Národní Divadlo, Rudolfinum, Lucerna, Reduta), as well as in bars and on the streets (the pianos could be found and played in random places all over the city!).
The capital of the Czech Republic is alive all the time, as is reminded by the colossal metronome that is swinging in the Letná Park perpetually, and the never-sleeping trams.
I have travelled around the country a little, and found some other lovely places: Plzeň, Kutná Hora, Český Krumlov - be sure to visit them!
During my stay, I have met a lot of great people from all over the world, and I am still in touch with many of them. It's hard to describe this experience, but it is truly amazing. It makes you feel the unity of the world, and understand that people are equally kind, communicable and share the sense of humour no matter where they are from.
Also, I got to know Czech people, and I should say that I love and respect this nation, as they are honest, open-minded, hard-working, determined, friendly and warm people. I as well enjoyed the local cuisine and, of course, the beer.
I am very happy that I chose the Czech technical university in Prague for my Erasmus stay, and I recommend doing the same to everybody!
I left for home knowing deeply, that I will come back in a while!

I came to FEL CTU, Prague for an academic year exchange Erasmus Mundus programme.
It was a fascinating experience for me, as I met people from all parts of the world.
I couldn’t be more satisfied with the quality of teaching and professors I got.
In a way CTU Prague is a great blend of genuine spirited fun and academic excellence.
This faculty is a great platform for people who yearn for global exposure and is like a launching pad for your careers.
Will look forward to come again and again and again....!!
