 with lectures and workshops not only on topics of computer security and the Internet. Among the lecturers, there are traditionally employees and students of our faculty, e.g. Lukáš Bařinka, Tomáš Čejka, Martin Bílý, and Karel Jílek. In addition to the open technologies, the conference also offers open food—OpenCola. The event is free of charge, but registration is required.
Topic
The conference traditionally focuses on the essential topics associated with installing and using Linux. Other open-source technologies in the area of networks, servers, or containers can not be missed. In the four halls, you can also learn about innovations in the field of computer security, Internet, administration, and development.
In addition to open-source software and hardware, there is going to be also open-source food—OpenCola. Its recipe is released under the GNU General Public License.
Program


Lukáš Bařinka lecturing on InstallFest last year

This year’s program offers two lecture and two workshops halls, where you can listen to 27 lectures and 13 practical workshops. The main topics of this year are computer security and the Internet. Of course, there is also interesting lectures for developers.
Those interested in a comprehensive overview of containerization will be delighted to visit the second hall in the Saturday afternoon. David Bečvařík, Michal Halenka, Tomáš Kukrál, and Jakub Veverka will familiarise participants with the general principles of application containerization and their deployment.
You can also find interesting people at the booths of various Linux distributions and other projects. You can look forward, for example, to Admins SH, Bastlers SH, 3D printing SH, ACTIVE 24, vpsFree, CZ.NIC, or SUSE.
About the Event
The festival focuses mainly on beginners, but the program is also for advanced users. The event is free of charge, but registration is required. All the necessary information is available on the festival website.
The lectures are going to be streamed and recorded in 4K quality by AVC Silicon Hill team. The new feature will be assistive technology for participants with visual problems. It will be possible to open the speaker’s output (slides, illustrations, demos) on your device.
