	The goal of FIT is to become a research oriented faculty, whose research results are recognized in the international community and whose researchers are actively participating in international research projects, publish in impacted journals and reviewed conferences. Given the structure of research activities and the history of the individual research groups at FIT, a large portion of our scientific and research work is oriented towards basic research.
	Members of our research groups participate in organizations of research conferences as IPC members. But in addition to that, several scientific conferences were organised in Prague by members of our teams within last few years. Examples include CryptArchi Workshop 2009, FPL2009 (International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications), TOOLS2012 (International Conference on Objects, Models, Components, Patterns), or ARCS2013 (International Conference on Architecture of Computing Systems). It became a tradition to organize the Prague Stringology Conference every year in September.
