BIE-BEZ – Security 
Annotation
Students understand the mathematical fundamentals of cryptography and have an overview of current cryptographic algorithms and applications: symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems, and hash functions. They also learn the fundamentals of secure programming and IT security, the fundamentals of designing and using modern cryptosystems for computer systems. They are able to properly and securely use cryptographic primitives and systems that are based on these primitives. Students are introduced to legal aspects of information security, security standards, social engineering, and basic principles of security management.
