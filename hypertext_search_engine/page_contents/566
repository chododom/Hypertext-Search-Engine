Lecturer:
Róbert Lórencz (guarantor), Jiří Buček
Tutor:
Róbert Lórencz (guarantor), Jiří Buček
Supervisor:
Department of Information Security
Synopsis:


Students understand the mathematical fundamentals of cryptography and have an overview of current cryptographic algorithms
                  and applications: symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems, and hash functions. They also learn the fundamentals of secure programming
                  and IT security, the fundamentals of designing and using modern cryptosystems for computer systems. They are able to properly
                  and securely use cryptographic primitives and systems that are based on these primitives. Students are introduced to legal
                  aspects of information security, security standards, social engineering, and basic principles of security management.
               


Requirements:


Fundamentals of linear algebra and discrete mathematics. Basics of number theory, elementary programming techniques. Knowledge
                  of runtime and memory complexities.
               


Syllabus of lectures:


1. Fundamentals of modular arithmetic and number theory. Fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
2. Properties of prime numbers. Exponentiation in modular arithmetic, fundamental concepts in cryptography, substitution ciphers.
3. Block ciphers, transposition ciphers, exponential ciphers. Establishment of a shared key.
4. Information theory, algorithm complexity theory.
5. Hash functions, MD5, SHA-x, HMAC.
6. Chinese remainder theorem, primality tests.
7. Stream ciphers, RC4. Block ciphers, DES, 3DES, AES. Modes of operation of block ciphers.
8. [2] Asymmetric cryptography, RSA, RSA-CRT, digital signature, certificates.
9. Secret sharing.
10. Principles of secure programming.
11. IT security. Perimeter security, firewall, antivirus, antispam.
12. Social engineering. Legal aspects of information security, standards.


Syllabus of tutorials:


1. Fundamentals of modular arithmetic, substitution cipher, affine ciphers.
2. Transposition, Vigenere cipher, block ciphers, exponential ciphers. Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
3. Hash functions, stream ciphers.
4. Primality tests, block ciphers.
5. Certificates, asymmetric cryptography.
6. SSL encryption.


Study Objective:


The module provides the fundamental theoretical knowledge and practical skills concerning cryptographic systems and their
                  use. Students will understand the principles of basic crypto algorithms and the basics of secure programming and IT security.
                  A key point is the understanding of the concept of security in the context of mathematical principles of cryptographic primitives,
                  as well as their use in complex systems. In the labs, students gain practical skills in using standard cryptographic methods
                  with emphasis on security and learn elementary cryptanalysis methods. Students are also introduced to the basic rules of security
                  management, security standards and legal aspects of security.
