I am a Full Professor in the Department of
Cybernetics of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering
of the Czech Technical University. I am a head
of a small Biomedical Imaging Algorithms (BIA) group, which is a
part of the
Center for Machine Perception.
My research mainly involves algorithms for medical and biological image processing. I am always looking for new collaborations and new projects, so if you have some interesting image data you need to analyze, feel free to contact me. I am also a member of the Academic Senate  of CTU of CTU and of the
Academic Senate of FEE CTU.
