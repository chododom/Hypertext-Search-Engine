Tutor:
Jakub Růžička (guarantor), Jakub Ács, Simona Buchovecká, Jiří Dostál, Tomáš Dvořáček, Martin Kolárik, Jan Kuběna, Tomáš Stefan
Supervisor:
Department of Information Security
Synopsis:


The course gives a professional and academic introduction to computer and information security using the ethical hacking approach,
                  which enables improved defence thanks to adopting an attacker mindset when discovering vulnerabilities, hands-on experience
                  with different attacks, facilitates linking theory and practice in significant areas of one's digital literacy, and can therefore
                  be utilized by (future) security professionals, (informed) decision-makers, (savvy) users and developers alike.
               
This course is taught in English.

Disclaimer: In spite of the fact that we'll try to fit our sessions' continuity with a typical sequence of steps in a penetration
                  test (pentest-standard.org), the content of the course and the order of its sections /teaching blocks might be subject to
                  change based on pace, level of proficiency, and other requirements of the course group.
               


Syllabus of tutorials:


Lectures are intertwined with exercises /tutorials.


Study Objective:


Upon completion of the course, the students will:
* be introduced to (both theory and practice of) common computer and information security vulnerabilities in their interdisciplinary
                  nature
               
* be able to perform basic penetration testing tasks (as defined by pentest-standard.org) using software tools and their own
                  program code
               
* understand the broader context of cybersecurity (macro level), the wide range of related topics for further self-driven
                  education and/or professional /academic specialization, and become savvier ICT users and developers (micro level)
               
* perceive ethical hacking as a 'problem-discovery' and 'problem-solving' tool (as opposed to 'problem-creating' tool)
