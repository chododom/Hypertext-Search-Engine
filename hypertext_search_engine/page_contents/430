PhD in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (2006 – 2009)Department of Telecommunication Engineering, FEE CTU
I have pursued a study abroad before, but I found something special when starting my PhD study in Electrical and Information Technology, back in 2006. I was at the department of telecommunication engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering (FEE), in the field of research on broadband wireless systems. Beside a student, I also worked as a researcher and involved in several research projects, funded by European Commission, national and Internal CTU grants. After the completion of my study, I sustained the research fellow position, became a teaching staff, and worked as the assistant to vice dean for education with specific duties on international study program and international cooperation.  With all those opportunities, responsibilities, challenges and rewards, I found myself as an integral part of CTU. Despite having returned back to Indonesia at the end of 2011, I still appointed as the external research collaborator at wireless network group at department of telecommunication engineering.
CTU means so much for me. It is not only a reputable, well-known technical university, has high rank reputation on engineering education and research, and rich with academic resources,  but also has an encouraging academic and research atmosphere, and professional but warmth teaching, research and administrative staffs. Even the managements are so kindness and cordiality.
Being a part of CTU is about gaining new experiences, taking new responsibilities, experiencing new cultures, and get on well with new people.  It is obviously, studying at CTU and living in Prague is so precious and memorable moment.

Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU)Erasmus exchange student 2013
I was an Erasmus exchange student at the Czech technical university in Prague, Faculty of Electrical Engineering for the winter semester of the year 2013.
I have quite carefully studied the available universities for me to stay as an Erasmus student.
The CTU attracted me since it has very good ratings, rich history, and the course offer for the exchange students was just perfect for me!
The application and admission procedure was very easy and straightforward; the staff of the International Office was caring and eager to help all the time.
The atmosphere at the university is great. The teachers I met were very friendly and supportive, and also very professional and passionate about their subjects. Courses are modern and faculty's laboratories are well equipped. I enjoyed the studies and I appreciate the knowledge I gained at the CTU every day. I must mention that it was the most successful semester of my whole bachelor studies!
I resided at the Strahov dormitories, and I genuinely liked it. Located in the middle of the city, on top of the Strahov hill, it is more than a complex of buildings - it's a strong student community, willing to help the incomer in every situation.
The city itself, Prague, is truly a wonderful, magical place. I felt in love with it, and hundreds of times I found myself just wandering around, slightly lost, discovering amazing views and mysterious passages. The most important thing, though, is that I really felt at home -the city is very cosy, friendly and nice in every other way.
Also, I see Prague as a musical city. Dvořák, Smetana, Mozart - and many others - lived and composed here, and this can't be unnoticed - the music is everywhere: in concert halls, theatres and venues (Národní Divadlo, Rudolfinum, Lucerna, Reduta), as well as in bars and on the streets (the pianos could be found and played in random places all over the city!).
The capital of the Czech Republic is alive all the time, as is reminded by the colossal metronome that is swinging in the Letná Park perpetually, and the never-sleeping trams.
I have travelled around the country a little, and found some other lovely places: Plzeň, Kutná Hora, Český Krumlov - be sure to visit them!
During my stay, I have met a lot of great people from all over the world, and I am still in touch with many of them. It's hard to describe this experience, but it is truly amazing. It makes you feel the unity of the world, and understand that people are equally kind, communicable and share the sense of humour no matter where they are from.
Also, I got to know Czech people, and I should say that I love and respect this nation, as they are honest, open-minded, hard-working, determined, friendly and warm people. I as well enjoyed the local cuisine and, of course, the beer.
I am very happy that I chose the Czech technical university in Prague for my Erasmus stay, and I recommend doing the same to everybody!
I left for home knowing deeply, that I will come back in a while!

National Institute of Technology, Warangal
I came to FEL CTU, Prague for an academic year exchange Erasmus Mundus programme.
It was a fascinating experience for me, as I met people from all parts of the world.
I couldn’t be more satisfied with the quality of teaching and professors I got.
In a way CTU Prague is a great blend of genuine spirited fun and academic excellence.
This faculty is a great platform for people who yearn for global exposure and is like a launching pad for your careers.
Will look forward to come again and again and again....!!
