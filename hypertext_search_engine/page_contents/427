Project




Agent-based algorithms for road traffic autonomous support systems: Project focusses on massive autonomous traffic system simulations mainly for the purposes of development of algorithms for autonomous traffic systems and multi-agent optimization of transportation logistics. Individual research results are cross-validated to ensure their scalability, reliability, fidelity and applicability in unified realistic autonomous traffic system.


Project




The Centre of competence RODOS (ROzvoj DOpravních Systémů – in Czech) is a consortium of leading Czech research institutions and business companies active in the field of telematics and intelligent transport systems.


Project




In Computation Game Theory we study and design new algorithms for finding optimal behavior in finite sequential scenarios, where agents have to deal with limited information, uncertainty, and competing opponents. Typical examples include classical card and board games, scenarios from the security domain, or auctions

Pre-seed Project - Autonomous UAVs for tactical missions and critical infrastructure protection
Pre-seed aims at design and deployment of algorithms for surveillance and patrolling on multiple autonomous UAVs for protection of critical infrastructures (oil-pipelines, power lines, etc.) and use in tactical missions. We try to develop a system for integrated command and control that increases autonomy of fleet of UAVs and provides common operation picture for the UAV operator.
