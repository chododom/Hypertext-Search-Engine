ABOUT US





OUR VISION is to create an international community at the Czech Technical University in Prague. We want to integrate exchange students into life in the Czech Republic and into events at our university. We create surroundings where different cultures meet and foreign and Czech students get to know each other.
We support the active involvement of our members, their self-realization and personal development  in a creative environment where there is a friendly and open atmosphere.
In this way we contribute to understanding, friendship and cooperation among the nations in Europe and throughout the world.


ISC SPIRIT BOOK
Our culture certainly stands on some values we all share. These values are crucially important to our organization and they
                        reflect the way we dream, work, cooperate and communicate. Learn more about our culture in our Spirit Book

SEE WHAT PAST EXCHANGE STUDENTS SAID ABOUT US




I have a lot of good memories of the Czech Technical University (CTU), but the first thing I have to emphasize is the International Student Club (ISC). Due to the nice and friendly atmosphere I could feel since the beginning.
I decided to help them with the organization of some activities like the orientation week, language meetings, sport events or trips. I’ve also been teaching my Spanish language to other students!
It has been an unbelievable experience for me that I recommend to every Erasmus student for sure!
Sergio Martín, Spain







Joining ISC CTU in Prague allowed me many things. At the beginning of the semester, it helped me with getting to know new people from all over the world. I started learning German (with a very nice teacher) in the Masarykova dormitory, I discovered lots of new places in Prague by attending the Café Lingea meetings, where my language skills were tested, and I learned to play voleyball.
I still keep many friends who I have visited/hosted after my Erasmus. That's one of the things I am most proud of – to be able to keep these friendships through time.
My advice for those starting an Erasmus is clear: Join ISC as soon as you get there, you won't regret it.
Mikel Ogueta, Spain
