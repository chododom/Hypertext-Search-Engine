BIE-SAP – Computer Structures and Architectures 
Annotation
Students understand basic digital computer units and their structures, functions, and hardware implementation: ALU, control unit, memory system, inputs, outputs, data storage and transfer. In the labs, students gain practical experience with the design and implementation of the logic of a simple processor using modern digital design tools.
Lecture Program

Logic functions and their descriptions, combinatorial circuits, implementation using gates.
Sequential circuits. Synchronous design, implementation using gates and flip-flops. Mealy and Moore automata.
Typical combinatorial and sequential components of a computer, their implementations (encoder, adder, counter, register).
Data, its representation and processing.
Arithmetic operations with signed numbers. Fix-point and floating point numbers.
Implementation of arithmetic operations.
Memories - memory cell structure, static and dynamic memories.
