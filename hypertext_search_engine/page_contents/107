In IDA, we try to make computers discover knowledge in data. To
this end we develop data mining and
machine
learning algorithms helping us detect regularities (frequent
patterns, strong associations), construct predictive models, and
ultimately identify the phenomenon that generated the observed
data.
Our expertise includes the strong paradigms of inductive
logic programming and relational
data mining, overcoming the deficiency of traditional data
mining tools which constrain their analysis to a mere single table
of a multi-relational database. Our main application area is
bioinformatics, mainly genomics.
