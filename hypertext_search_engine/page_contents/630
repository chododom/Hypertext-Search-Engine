Living and studying in Prague

One of the most beautiful cities in the world
Full of historical places
Reasonable prices and low living costs
Situated in the centre of Europe, Prague is often called the Heart of Europe or the City of a Hundred Spires. Since medieval times, this location has made Prague into a great attraction for merchants and cosmopolitan foreigners. Throughout the centuries different architectural styles and their creators have shaped the city’s unique atmosphere. The city centre is included in the UNESCO’S world cultural heritage list.
Culture
Prague is a true cultural treasure house, bursting with fascinating museums, galleries, theatres and music venues. The city is frequently host to prestigious exhibitions, events, and international festivals.
Nightlife
Not only is Prague a cultural city, it is also a vibrant city with such diverse night life, whether you want to go to the cinema, theatre, dine, dance or party all night.

Sports
Prague has a wide range of indoors and outdoors sports activities. There is something for everyone! Students can join the university Institute of Physical Education and Sports which offers more than 40 types of sport.  Students can sign up for courses in the countryside or in the mountains in the summer and winter seasons. In the summer months, the emphasis is on water sports, ball games, mountaineering, windsurfing and cycling. The main winter sports are cross-country skiing, downhill skiing and snowboarding.
