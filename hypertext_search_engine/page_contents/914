New GAČR project (2017-2019) by Tomáš Krajník: Spatio Temporal Representations for Life-Long Mobile Robot Navigation


Project




New international Horizon 2020 ELECTRIFIC project in the Artificial Intelligence for Transport and Mobility group, AIC.
The project will solve:
Context-aware travel planning and scheduling algorithms for electric vehicles 
Market-based charging capacity allocation and demand management mechanisms for electric vehicles

The Stratosphere IPS is a free software Intrusion Prevention System that uses Machine Learning to detect and block known malicious behaviors in the network traffic. 
The Stratosphere IPS Project has participated in the CitizenLab Summer Institute 2015, organized by the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto. The workshop gets together the most significant actors protecting the digital rights of civil society, including privacy, anti-censorship and anti-surveillance research.


Project




Extension of the Traffic Flow Modeling Project. A number of extensions will be developed to further improve the pedestrian flow model, allowing simulation and evaluation of a wider range of scenarios and improve performance and believability of the model on existing scenarios.


Project




Our researcher Milan Rollo participates in project for forest monitoring by unmanned aerial vehicles sponsored by The Ministry of Agriculture of the Czech Republic.


Project




AgentFly is an agent-based system for a large scale air traffic simulation. It is able to simulate tens of thousands airplanes in detail, e.g. to compute fuel consumption. It also models cognitive behavior of air traffic controllers to simulate their activities and workload. The AgentFly can be used to simulate complete air traffic over US to predict future air traffic


Project




New GACR project by Antonin Komenda: Heuristic Search for Multiagent and Factored Planning


Project




GAČR project by Jan Faigl: Adaptive Informative Path Planning in Autonomous Data Collection in Dynamic Unstructured Environments


Project




Agent-based algorithms for road traffic autonomous support systems: Project focusses on massive autonomous traffic system simulations mainly for the purposes of development of algorithms for autonomous traffic systems and multi-agent optimization of transportation logistics. Individual research results are cross-validated to ensure their scalability, reliability, fidelity and applicability in unified realistic autonomous traffic system.


Project




The Centre of competence RODOS (ROzvoj DOpravních Systémů – in Czech) is a consortium of leading Czech research institutions and business companies active in the field of telematics and intelligent transport systems.


Project




In Computation Game Theory we study and design new algorithms for finding optimal behavior in finite sequential scenarios, where agents have to deal with limited information, uncertainty, and competing opponents. Typical examples include classical card and board games, scenarios from the security domain, or auctions


Project




Pre-seed Project - Autonomous UAVs for tactical missions and critical infrastructure protection
Pre-seed aims at design and deployment of algorithms for surveillance and patrolling on multiple autonomous UAVs for protection of critical infrastructures (oil-pipelines, power lines, etc.) and use in tactical missions. We try to develop a system for integrated command and control that increases autonomy of fleet of UAVs and provides common operation picture for the UAV operator.
