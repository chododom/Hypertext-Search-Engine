RI data, our aim is to better understand how the brain and deep brain stimulation work. 



Free-space and nonlinear fiber opticsThe optical research team engages in nonlinear fiber optics for all-optical signal processing and ultrafast optical network components, optical beams and ultra-short optical pulse propagation, in atmospheric influence on free-space optic (FSO) links and last but not least in optical sensors. Currently our scientific effort is focused on fundamental research as well as on cooperation with industry in the field of applied research. 
High-current dischargesWe are a group at the department of physics, working in the field of basic research of hot and dense plasma, especially focusing on the high-current lightning-like discharges. 
Human-Computer Interaction GroupThe Human-Computer Interaction is an interdisciplinary field, studying the factors that affect the quality and effectiveness of the use of computing systems. We focus on methods of clear communication of information to the users through various modalities, as well as on novel input techniques for various "non-traditional" user groups, such as people in mobile situations, the elderly, the vision-impaired, or the people with motor impairments. 
Increasing competitiveness of enterprises in electrotechnical industryResearch activity concentrates on analysis of conditions and determination of factors affecting increase of competitive ability of industrial enterprises, especially in electrical industry. Research is conducted with regard to overcoming conflicts within the value forming chain of the enterprise and within a broader supply chain. 
Intelligent Data Analysis Research GroupIn the Intelligent Data Analysis research lab we develop algorithms for mining knowledge from data using  statistical-relational machine learning and inductive logic programming. We also investigate unorthodox optimization techniques such as evolutionary algorithms. We apply our methods mainly in bioinformatics and computational biology. 


MAGLAB - Laboratory of sensors and magnetic measurementsApplications of sensors, mainly magnetic. Development of new magnetic materials, sensors and magnetometers. Measurement and calibration systems mainly for space, military and security applications. Electric current sensors. 
Medical Image ProcessingWe develop new algorithms for biomedical image processing. We process images from different modalities, such as magnetic resonance, ultrasound, computed tomography, or microscopy. We work in 2D, 3D and 4D. We know how to preprocess the data, how to register, segment, model, reconstruct and classify them. We use techniques from image processing, numerical mathematics, as well as machine learning. 
METLAB - Metrology of electrical quantitiesIn the framework of a research oriented on methods and devices for precision measurement of electrical impedance we pay particular attention to problems of metrological application of the quantum Hall effect and, notably, to realization of a system for calibrating precision wideband LCR meters.
Microwave MeasurementsWe are a research group engaged in the microwave measurement, design and construct of high-frequency circuits and systems. Our work covers a wide spectrum of the microwave domain from the theory of the calibration-correction methods to complex designs and large microwave measurement systems.
NavLIS - Navigation group of the Laboratory of Aircraft Instrumentation SystemsWe deal with R&D of navigation systems and their algorithms applicable in applications, such as the navigation of aerial and ground vehicles, robots, UAVs, intelligent metal detectors, and hand-held devices. We fuse available systems data by a Kalman filter. Those systems are for instance inertial and tilt sensors, GNSS, magnetometers, and cameras. Our aim is to provide as precise estimation of position and attitude as possible no matter harsh environmental conditions and varying dynamics. 

PhotovoltaicA photovoltaic research team deals with problems of physics, construction and technology of photovoltaic cells; also engages in diagnostics of semiconductor cells and optimization of photovoltaic systems. Moreover, the team maintains Laboratory of Photovoltaic Systems Diagnostics and operates demo 3kW photovoltaic system including on-line monitoring of operational data shown at Internet web site. 
Plasma theory group of the Department of PhysicsResearch group from the Department of Physics focused on the plasma theory especially on the waves and instabilities and their numerical solution both in the astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. 
Quantum StructuresWe are solving actual problems of the theory of orthomodular algebraic structures or operator algebras and the measure theory built on these structures. These topics are motivated by the quantum theory. We are one of a few research teams in the world capable to combine methods of a functional analysis (continuos structures) and of an algebra and combinatorics (discrete structures).
Signal Analysis, Modelling, and InterpretationSAMI group is concerned with fundamental and applied research in biomedical engineering. Our main scope of interest focus on speech, biological signals, digital signal processing and machine learning with background in neurology, phoniatry, speech therapy and physiology. 
Speech Processing LaboratoryWe deal with the analysis and the processing of speech signal with the focus on speech recognition systems and speech enhancement for communication purposes. Currently we work mainly on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition with the focus on the processing of distorted speech or spontaneous utterances. Concerning speech enhancement, we use these techniques in a communication from noisy environment or in the extraction of features for robust speech recognition systems working with noisy speech. 
Radiowave PropagationWe are a research group interested in the propagation of radio waves in the atmosphere. Our primary goal is development of signal propagation models for planning of advanced communication systems such as mobile networks.
Theory of Electromagnetic FieldWe work on general solution and modeling of electromagnetic fields. Our focus is on basic research in the field of microwave transmission lines, metamaterials and propagation of UWB signals, including applications.
TORSCHE Scheduling toolbox for MatlabOur team mainly focuses on the desing and development of the scheduling algorithms for the optimization of production, utilization of human resources, optimization of speed of code computation or effective utilization of communication lines. One of the main efforts of our group is to bring the theoretical approaches to the form suitable for the real-world applications. 
Transmission Media and SystemsThe aim of our research activities is in increasing speed of digital transmission systems, reliability, performance and searching for a new deployment of the transmission media, optimization of networks and communication protocols to improve and streamline their use.
