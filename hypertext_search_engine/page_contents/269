Invited Talk - Eduard Gröller - A Matter of Scale



   Speaker: Eduard Gröller (TU Wien, Austria) 

Date: June 22, 2018 11:00 
Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-301 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2)  



Abstract: Scale and scalability have been recurring topics in visual computing. Visual computing uses computer‐supported, interactive, visual representations of (abstract) data to amplify cognition. In recent years data complexity concerning volume, veracity, velocity, and variety has increased considerably. Multiscale models, e.g., from structural biology, require multiscale dynamic color mapping with sometimes overlapping or contradicting colors. We present a technique, which adaptively, based on the current scale level, nonlinearly and seamlessly adjusts the color scheme to depict or distinguish the currently best visible structural information. Data‐sensitive navigation for user‐interface elements is presented. The approach re-scales and normalizes user input according to visual change, and also visually communicates this re-scaling and normalization. In this way, output‐sensitive interactions can be realized. Another example deals with multiscale visualization and scale-adaptive modification of DNA nanostructures. This new way of observing, interacting with, and creating DNA nanostructures enables domain experts to approach their work in any of the available semantic abstraction levels, supporting both low-level manipulations and high-level visualization and modifications. Research challenges and directions with respect to scale and scalability are sketched at the end of the talk.

Invited Talk - TU Delft: Electronic Partners for navigation habits support



Presenters: Pietro Pasotti, Catholijn Jonker (Interactive Intelligence, TU Delft)


Date: November 14, 2017 4:30 PM - 6:00 PM 

Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-301 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2) 


Annotation:


With the rise of AI and Data Science supportive technology increasingly takes decisions on our behalf, such as which data to share with whom or who to contact if help is needed. In the CoreSAEP project (lead by Dr. M. Birna van Riemsdijk - TU Delft) we develop theory and technology for creating software that understands and adapts to our norms and values in taking such decisions, which we call Socially Adaptive Computing.
In this presentation we focus on one such agent, called HabINT, that aims at supporting people in their daily activities. We give an overview of the knowledge representation formalism that HabINT uses to reason about norms, values, and habitual behaviour. 
The Naviterier project at the HCI Center, Department of Computer Graphics and Interaction in Prague aims at supporting visually impaired people in their navigation-related tasks developing dedicated software. In the presentation, we discuss how to integrate the technology from both groups to provide even stronger support for visually impaired people even if they develop mental impairments related to aging.


About presenters:


Prof. Catholijn Jonker is a full professor of Interactive Intelligence at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science of the Delft University of Technology. Catholijn is EurAI Fellow since 2015, and EurAI board member since 2016, EurAI is the European Association for Artificial Intelligence.

Invited Talk - Tobias Ritschel - Computing the Best Image Possible



   Speaker: Tobias Ritschel (University College London, UK) 

Date: May 30, 2017 17:00 
Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-127 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2)  




Abstract:


Opinions vary on what is the best image a machine can synthesize. In this talk I will discuss some possible answers: First, physical accuracy has been a classic and quantifiable objective, and I will give an example of a technique to robustly compute unbiased images. Another important aspect to discuss is computational efficiency. I will explain how rasterization abilities of modern graphics hardware can be used to introduce global illumination at interactive frame rates. Ultimately, images are made to be perceived by humans, where it is not so easy to say which image is „better“, e.g. when comparing to a reference. I will discuss the particular challenge of computing what is the best (stereo) image using a perceptual model. If the „best“ image only exists in the mind of user, computing this image is an even more substantial challenge. I will discuss examples of using Internet image collections to guide users when realizing what they imagine. Finally, images have commonly been synthesized from complete information. I will discuss some alternatives, where only incomplete information is available and extrapolation from sparse example images is made to achieve better coverage by many images.

Invited Talk - Stefan Leijnen - Utilizing Deep Learning as a Tool for Creativity



   Speaker: Stefan Leijnen (Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Netherlands) 

Date: May 26, 2017 13:30 
Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-301 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2)  




Abstract:


Recent years have seen a number of breakthroughs that indicate a renewed interest in the possibilities of creative machines. Game-playing agents developed by Google Deepmind are capable of learning surprisingly original solutions. Deep learning allows anyone to make paintings in the style of famous artists. Other computational tools are now used to inspire and guide human designers. In this talk, we will look at examples of creative machine learning, consider to what extent they qualify as being creative, and discuss what additional steps would be necessary for artificial creativity.


About the speaker:


Stefan Leijnen is lecturer and researcher of artificial intelligence at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. His primary research interest is in understanding how novelty arises from dynamical systems, particularly in neural networks. More generally, he is interested in generative computational methods, deep learning and epistomology. He has recently founded the Asimov Institute, an independent research organization aiming to develop technological solutions for creativity and control of machine learning.



Two talks from Purdue university (USA)



    High Performance Computer Graphics Lab at Purdue and DCGI invite you for two special presentations to be held  
on Monday,  June 5, 2017 – from 10:00 and 11:00, 
Karlovo nám. 13, building E, room KN:E-301 
(Šrámek lecture hall).   



Talk Nr. 1 - Alejandra J. Magana: Opportunities and Challenges of Visuohaptic Simulations for Conceptual Learning



  



Abstract: 
While it is clear that the use of computer simulations has a positive effect on
learning when compared to instruction without computer simulations, there is still
room for improvement to fully realize their benefits for learning. Haptic
technologies can fulfill the educational potential of computer simulations by adding
the sense of touch. Visuohaptic simulations may not only help students visualize
abstract or invisible concepts, but they may also have the capability of enriching the
learning experience and enhancing retention. Our argument is based on the idea
that haptic technology can support embodied learning by grounding movements
during the learning process as learners manipulate and interact with virtual objects
via the haptic interface. Still, previous work that has compared visual simulations
versus visuohaptic simulations has not reported conclusive results.


This research seminar provides an overview of a design-based research program
that investigates effectiveness of the use of visuohaptic simulations to support the
understanding of difficult concepts in science. We explored a sequencing approach
to address the possibility of visual information undermining tactile information,
when presented together. Our preliminary studies have shown promising results.




    Alejandra J. Magana is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Technology with a courtesy appointment at the School of Engineering Education at Purdue University. Her research program investigates how model-based cognition in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) can be better supported by means of computing tools.  



Talk Nr. 2 - Bedrich Benes: Modeling Plant Life in Computer Graphics



  



Abstract: 
Synthesizing natural scenes with realistic vegetation has always been an interesting research topic in computer graphics. As frequent objects in our daily life, vegetation is required in almost all virtual sceneries, ranging from single plants and trees to wide outdoor ecosystems. The human visual system is perfectly trained to see any imperfections and irregularities. Therefore, the appearance and the inhomogeneous structure of plants still pose many challenges to computer graphics researchers. Although rich and detailed virtual environments become popular in applications like games, movies or urban visualization, storing and transmitting as well as modeling or rendering such objects with full detail is beyond the capabilities even of modern graphics hardware. Figure 1 shows a small forest with large amount of detail modeled through a modern reconstruction algorithm. This talk will cover several latest algorithms and techniques in modeling vegetation in computer graphics. In particular, we will focus on advances in 1) procedural and inverse-procedural modeling, 2) biologically-based approaches, and 3) user-assisted approaches for vegetation modeling. 




    Bedrich Benes  is a professor of Computer Graphics Technology at Purdue University and a director of the High Performance Computer Graphics Laboratory. His area of research is in procedural and inverse procedural modeling and simulation of natural phenomena and he has published over 100 research papers in the field. Dr. Benes has collaborated with the National Science Foundation, NASA, Adobe Research, Intel, Siemens, Samsung, Department of Energy, and Ford Inc., among others. He has worked as IPC member of various conferences including Siggraph/Siggraph Asia (4x), Eurographics (5x), and he is a papers chair of Eurographics 2017. He also works as associate editor of Computer Graphics Forum and Computers & Graphics. His graduate students work in Adobe, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Samsung, and Siemens.

20th Student scientific seminar User Interfaces at HTW Dresden



In the days 24.11 and 25.11. 2016  20th student scientific seminar User Interfaces was held in the building of HTW Dresden (University of Applied Sciences in Dresden).


Students delivered talks about their results achieved in scientific projects. Their form of participation were either thesis (BSc. or MSc.) or student projects (programme of the workshop is here). Main topics discussed in the seminar were user interfaces and computer graphics issues. Workshop organization was shared by Department of Computer Graphics and Interaction at FEL CTU Prague and Faculty of Informatics HTW Dresden. The seminar has quite a long tradition and one of aims of the seminar is to attract attention of students (both BSc.and MSc. ones) towards scientific work. The assumption is that an integral part of scientific work is presentation of the results achieved to international audience in English. A bunch of students who participated in the workshop in the past entered PhD study later on where they continued in many cases in research they presented during the workshop. 


After 20 years it is possible to make positive evaluation of the workshop. The scientific quality of talks is steadily increasing as well as the ability of students to communicate in English. An effort has been made to conform the format of the workshop in such a way that it should be similar to format of standard international workshops. E.g. in 2015 Proceedings were published – the Proceedings had a form of abstracts where information about each contribution was presented. Proceedings from this year will have a form of Technical report published by HTW Dresden where each talk will be presented in the form of extended abstract. In general it is possible to say that students evaluate the event as interesting and beneficial one.


In the workshop participated the following students from FEL:


 BSc. students: Gintner Vojtěch, Szczurková Jana, Riganová Michaela

 MSc. students: Novák Vojtěch, Dzurenko Martin

 PhD. students: Kutíková Anna, Balata Jan




Proceedings can be donwloaded here.

Invited Talk - Eduard Gröller - Visual Computing and Comparative Visualization



   Speaker: Eduard Gröller (TU Vienna, Austria) 

Date: April 15, 2016 11:00 - 12:00 
Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-301 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2)  




Abstract:


Visualization and Visual Computing use computer-supported,
interactive, visual representations of (abstract) data to amplify
cognition. In recent years data complexity and variability has increased
considerably. This is due to new data sources as well as the
availability of uncertainty, error and tolerance information. Instead of
individual objects entire sets, collections, and ensembles are visually
investigated. This raises the need for effective comparative
visualization approaches. Visual data science and computational sciences
provide vast amounts of digital variations of a phenomenon which can be
explored through superposition, juxtaposition and explicit difference
encoding. A few examples of comparative approaches coming from the
various areas of visualization, i.e., scientific visualization,
information visualization and visual analytics will be treated in more
detail. Analysis techniques which combine visualization and simulation
to assist decision making in flooding scenarios, indoor lighting design
and city planning will be discussed. Given the amplified data
variability, comparative visualization techniques are likely to gain in
importance in the future. Research challenges, directions, and issues
concerning this innovative area are sketched at the end of the talk.

Adam Sporka's talk at GDS 2015: Adaptive Music in Kingdom Come: Deliverance



The music in our game responds to the actions of the player. It goes from peaceful to agitated when the player is attacked by enemy NPC, from neutral to dark when entering a cave, etc. The challenge is to respond swiftly, make the transitions between parts of the soundtrack as seamless as possible (maintain the correct voicing and harmonic progressions), and above all, have diverse yet consistent soundtrack.

Invited Talk - Marc Stamminger - Capturing the Real World with Commodity Depth Cameras



   Speaker: Marc Stamminger (Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany) 

Date: November 7, 2014 12:45 - 13:45 
Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-301 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2)  




Abstract:


In this talk I describe methods to capture the real world around us using cheap commodity 3D-cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect or any of its successors. These cameras deliver 30 depth images per second, but each at only low quality. Yet, with the fusion of such a depth image stream, 3D-scans of decent quality can be made. I will describe extensions that make it possible to scan large scenes and show results from scanning sessions in an excavation site in Turkey. Another extension handles the realtime capturing of deformable objects such as faces, hands, or bodies. Finally, I will show a very recent new realtime approach combining depth and RGB-data to increase the resolution of the captured geometry.


Invited Talk - Stefan Gumhold - Object Pose Estimation and Tracking with 3D Object Coordinates



   Speaker: Stefan Gumhold (TU Dresden, Germany) 

Date: October 24, 2014 12:45 - 13:30 
Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-301 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2)  




Abstract:


This work addresses the problem of estimating and tracking the 6D Pose of specific objects from a single RGB-D image. We present a flexible approach that can deal with generic objects, both textured and texture-less. The key new concept is a learned, intermediate representation in form of a dense 3D object coordinate estimate paired with a dense object labelling. Random forests are exploited to predict 3D object coordinates and object probability from local image patches. We pair this discriminative estimate with a generative explanation of the RGB-D image in an energy functional that is robustly minimized with a RANSAC like approach. Tracking is based on the particle filter framework for which we designed efficient proposal distributions in order to efficiently sample the six dimensional parameter space of object poses. The proposed approach allows for real-time tracking and is very robust to changes in lighting and to occlusions.

Invited Talk - Michael Guthe - GPU Ray Tracing - Concepts, Advances and Challenges



   Speaker: Michael Guthe (University of Bayreuth, Germany) 

Date: June 19, 2014 14:00 - 15:00 
Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-301 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2)  




Abstract:


Due to the immense parallel processing power of modern graphics hardware, ray tracing algorithms and applications on the GPU have emerged. Depsite several architectural challanges, real-time recursive ray tracing has become possible. More sophisticated global illumination algorithms however still pose major challanges for efficient implementations on the GPU. After a short introduction into the programming model and the processing flow of GPUs, recent advances in real-time ray tracing will be discussed. These include acceleration data structures as well as a study of memory access and latency during intersection testing. In this context, the general problem of divergence and approaches to improve thread utilization will also be presented. The talk closes with an overview of techniques to implement more sophisticated global illumination algorithms like path tracing, bi-directional path tracing and Metropolis light transport, while putting an emphasis on the open problems in this field.

Invited Talk - Bedřich Beneš - Inverse Procedural Modeling



   Speaker: Bedřich Beneš (Purdue University, USA) 

Date: December 6, 2013 11:00 - 12:00 
Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-301 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2)  




Abstract:


Procedural modeling has proven to be a powerful set of algorithms and techniques and it has been used for generation of a wide-variety of objects and effects. However, their definition is a tedious and non-intuitive task that is usually done either by experts, or by a trial and error approach. In this presentation, we will show some of our results in the field of inverse procedural modeling where we attempt to find a procedural representation of an existing object or a scene. Various examples of learning models from biology, urban models, and other procedural representations will be presented.

Invited Talk - Martin Fuchs - Visual Computing beyond Pictures



   Speaker: Martin Fuchs (University of Stuttgart, Germany) 

Date: November 15, 2013 11:00 - 12:00 
Place: ČVUT FEL, lecture room KN:E-301 (Karlovo náměstí 13, Praha 2)  




Abstract:


Visual computing encompasses a multitude of subjects which have evolved around a common goal: creating and understanding worlds with pictures. Recently, appearance fabrication has emerged as an exciting topic in visual computing: it addresses how to employ rapid manufacturing techniques in order to build tangible artifacts which have a predefined appearance. In this talk, I will present my contributions to appearance manufacturing, discussing passive reflectance field displays and printed subsurface scattering. Further, I will show how the use of rapid manufacturing techniques for computational photography enables refocusing images after they were taken.

INVITED TALKS on 18. 1. 2011


10:00 Miloš Šrámek (Austrian Academy of Sciences): Voxelization of geometric objects with sharp details


Voxelization is a sampling process that transforms a continuously defined object into a discrete one represented as a voxel field. The voxel field can be used for rendering or other purposes which often involve a reconstruction of a continuous approximation of the original object. Objects to be voxelized need to fulfill certain representability conditions; otherwise, disturbing artifacts appear during reconstruction. We present a new method for voxelization of solid objects containing sharp details which extends the traditional distance-based voxelization by an a-priori detection of sharp object details and their subsequent modification in such a way that the resulting object to be voxelized fulfills the representability conditions. We exemplify the method by two classes of solid objects that normally contain such sharp details: implicit solids and solids resulting from CSG operations. In both cases, the sharp details are rounded to a specific curvature dictated by the sampling distance.
